# HTML CSS practice

- I have created a small website using HTML and CSS
- In this website , I learned about :
  - em (for size)
  - vh (for size)
  - user-select : none (user selection is prohibited)
  - @media (for it UI in mobile)
  - border-radius: 50%; (for round image)
  - span is used in such a way that it will jump to that specific url 
  - on clicking login/register/forgetpassword it will assign the url with their repsective hastags by using < a href> anchor tag
